In the contemporary landscape of global social media, an unsettling trend has 
emerged, revealing the susceptibility of various platforms to illicit activities. The 
pervasive nature of social media, particularly on platforms like Twitter and 
Instagram, has made them breeding grounds for the dissemination of inappropriate 
messages. Recognizing the escalating prevalence of such activities, it becomes 
imperative to identify and address the use of restrictive language on these platforms.
This study focuses on the extraction of data from Instagram and Twitter, utilizing 
third-party applications like Apify for this purpose. The data is then classified using 
machine learning models into distinct groups: toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, 
insult, and identity_hate. The intention is to proactively detect and manage content 
that falls within these undesirable categories. By subtly substituting a term closely 
related to the prohibited word in the query, a form of discreet moderation is 
introduced. This artful linguistic exchange serves as a strategic intervention, 
effectively mitigating the overall impact and consequences of the content to a certain 
extent. The goal is to soften the tone and nature of the messages circulating on these 
platforms, contributing to a more constructive and positive online environment. As 
social media continues to play a pivotal role in global communication, initiatives 
like these become crucial in maintaining a safer and more responsible digital space.
